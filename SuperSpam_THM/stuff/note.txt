12th January: Note to self. Our IDS seems to be experiencing high volumes of unusual activity.
We need to contact our security consultants as soon as possible. I fear something bad is going

occuring during midnight. I am not sure why.. This is very odd... -adam

15th January: I could swear I created a new blog just yesterday. For some reason it is gone... -adam

24th January: Of course it is... - super-spam :)
